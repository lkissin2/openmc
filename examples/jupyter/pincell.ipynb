    "Materials in OpenMC are defined as a set of nuclides with specified atom/weight fractions. To begin, we will create a material by making an instance of the `Material` class. In OpenMC, many objects, including materials, are identified by a \"unique ID\" that is simply just a positive integer. These IDs are used when exporting XML files that the solver reads in. They also appear in the output and can be used for identification. Since an integer ID is not very useful by itself, you can also give a material a `name` as well."

    "At this point, we have three materials defined, exported to XML, and ready to be used in our model. To finish our model, we need to define the geometric arrangement of materials. OpenMC represents physical volumes using constructive solid geometry (CSG), also known as combinatorial geometry. The object that allows us to assign a material to a region of space is called a `Cell` (same concept in MCNP, for those familiar). In order to define a region that we can assign to a cell, we must first define surfaces which bound the region. A *surface* is a locus of zeros of a function of Cartesian coordinates $x$, $y$, and $z$, e.g.\n",
    "\n",

A surface *half-space* is the region whose points satisfy a positive or negative inequality of the surface equation. For example, for a sphere of radius one centered at the origin, the surface equation is $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1 = 0$. Thus, we say that the negative half-space of the sphere, is defined as the collection of points satisfying $f(x,y,z) < 0$, which one can reason is the inside of the sphere. Conversely, the positive half-space of the sphere would correspond to all points outside of the sphere.\n",
